This project is a front-end Apple website clone developed using React.js and Vite, aimed at replicating the clean, minimal,
and modern user interface of Apple’s official website. The application focuses on building a responsive layout and reusable 
components while following modern front-end development practices.

The website is built purely for learning and practice purposes and demonstrates how a real-world product landing page
can be structured using React’s component-based architecture. It highlights key Apple-style sections such as navigation, 
hero banners, product showcases, and footer content.
